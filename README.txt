Lab 8 README
====================================================
Task 1 - CNN Baseline

This code does not need any packages installed to run. It can simply be run natively on Google Colab.
To run the code, open Google Colab and open cnn.ipynb, then click runtime > run all.

The idea behind this task is to train a CNN to recognize images through the CIFAR-10 dataset.
This dataset contains 60000 images in 10 classes.

The base code achieves an accuracy of just over 70%. The goal was to beat that. This was done by building
a much deeper neural architecture that would be able to more accurately learn the features of the obejects.

Running 15 epochs yields around 83% accuracy.

====================================================
Task 3 - Game Development

Steps to running the code:
1. Make sure pygame and pgzero are installed by typing the following commands into your command prompt:
	pip install pygame
	pip install pgzero
2. Drag "(3) Balloon Flight.py" into IDE
3. Click run

Functions added: Lives, Game stars 50% faster, Added one more tree and house, 
		     Increase speed according to level
